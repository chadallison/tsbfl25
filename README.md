### Luckiest Teams Season Long

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Self Luck and Opponent Luck

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)<!-- -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Average Weekly Finishing Position

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->

For example: if Hank had the best score in the league, the third best
score in the league, and the second best score in the league through
three weeks, his average weekly finishing position would be (1 + 3 + 2)
/ 3 = 2. Closely related to points per game, but not the exact same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chug Analysis

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)<!-- -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Win Percentage by Strength of Schedule

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

Strength of schedule is calculated as the average projected score of
your opponents. So if JP were to play three opponents with projected
scores of 100, 110, and 120, his SOS rating would be (100 + 110 + 120) /
3 = 110.
