### Average Weekly Finishing Position

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->

For example: if Hank had the best score in the league, the third best
score in the league, and the second best score in the league through
three weeks, his average weekly finishing position would be (1 + 3 + 2)
/ 3 = 2. Closely related to points per game, but not the exact same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chug Analysis

Where literally anyone chug?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Win Percentage by Strength of Schedule

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

Strength of schedule is calculated as the average projected score of
your opponents. So if JP were to play three opponents with projected
scores of 100, 110, and 120, his SOS rating would be (100 + 110 + 120) /
3 = 110.

### Wins When Projected to Lose

- Eric: 3 wins when projected to lose
- JP: 3 wins when projected to lose
- Adam: 1 win when projected to lose
- Andrew: 1 win when projected to lose
- Chad: 1 win when projected to lose
- Hank: 1 win when projected to lose
- Isaac: 1 win when projected to lose
- David: 0 wins when projected to lose
- Josh: 0 wins when projected to lose
- Matthew: 0 wins when projected to lose

### Team Records vs League Median

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Supreme Luck Merchant

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)<!-- -->

**Label numbers explained**: To calculate these overall values, I
normalized both everyone’s strength of schedule ratings and their luck
ratings so that they are on the same scale. Note that my calculation
assumes these two are equal, i.e. strength of schedule and opponent
scoring under average play an equal role in determining someone’s “luck”
as we’re loosely defining it. Once I have these two normalized numbers,
I subtract the normalized SOS score from the normalized luck score
because a lower SOS is “luckier” so to speak. This then determines the
overall number you see in parentheses next to everyone’s names.

### Parlay Tracking

### Opponent Adjusted PPG

### Opponent Scoring Compared to Adjusted PPG

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png)<!-- -->

This one is a work in progress and another pseudo-attempt at
visualizing/quantifying strength of schedule. The motivation behind it
is to get average opponent PPG in games where they are not playing you.
For example, suppose I am playing Hank. His “adjusted PPG” would be his
PPG in games he has played against everyone else but me. So if Hank
scored 100 against me, 110 against David, 120 against JP, 80 against
Adam, and 95 against Josh, his “adjusted PPG” would be (110 + 120 + 80 +
95) / 4 = 101.25. If you wanted to, you could go a step further with
this and say that given that number, Hank scoring 100 against me would
be him under performing by 1.25 points compared to his “adjusted PPG” of
101.25. That is how the y-axis is calculated. *If you made it this far
and are reading this, I love you.* I haven’t yet messed with flipping
axes, so for now, further right would indicate tougher competition, on
average, and higher would indicate your opponent scoring higher than
“expected” given their adjusted PPG.
