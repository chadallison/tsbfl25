### Luckiest Teams This Past Week

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Luckiest Teams Season Long

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Self Luck and Opponent Luck

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)<!-- -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Average Weekly Finishing Position

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->

For example: if Hank had the best score in the league, the third best
score in the league, and the second best score in the league through
three weeks, his average weekly finishing position would be (1 + 3 + 2)
/ 3 = 2. Closely related to points per game, but not the exact same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chug Analysis

Where Adam chug?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Win Percentage by Strength of Schedule

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

Strength of schedule is calculated as the average projected score of
your opponents. So if JP were to play three opponents with projected
scores of 100, 110, and 120, his SOS rating would be (100 + 110 + 120) /
3 = 110.

### Team Records vs League Median

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)<!-- -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Supreme Luck Merchant

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)<!-- -->

**Label numbers explained**: To calculate these overall values, I
normalized both everyone’s strength of schedule ratings and their luck
ratings so that they are on the same scale. Note that my calculation
assumes these two are equal, i.e. strength of schedule and opponent
scoring under average play an equal role in determining someone’s “luck”
as we’re loosely defining it. Once I have these two normalized numbers,
I subtract the normalized SOS score from the normalized luck score
because a lower SOS is “luckier” so to speak. This then determines the
overall number you see in parentheses next to everyone’s names.
