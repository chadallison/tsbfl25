### Average Weekly Finishing Position

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)<!-- -->

For example: if Hank had the best score in the league, the third best
score in the league, and the second best score in the league through
three weeks, his average weekly finishing position would be (1 + 3 + 2)
/ 3 = 2. Closely related to points per game, but not the exact same.

For example: if Hank had the best score in the league, the third best
score in the league, and the second best score in the league through
three weeks, his average weekly finishing position would be (1 + 3 + 2)
/ 3 = 2. Closely related to points per game, but not the exact same.
